3. Grant of License and Limitations
3.1. Scope of License
Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and upon Licensee's full payment of the applicable fees, Highsoft grants Licensee the right to use the Licensed Software strictly within the scope of the granted License type, and to receive services and Releases included in Highcharts Advantage as described below.

The License, which shall be registered in Licensee's name, shall commence on Delivery Date and be effective until terminated in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement.

When entering into this Agreement, Licensee must choose and state:

the Software products to be included in the license;
one or more of the License types described in section 4, and;
the number of authorized Developers to be included in the License, and;
which Web Application(s) and/or SaaS Application(s) the Licensed Software will be used in, if purchasing a SaaS License or SaaS+ License as further described in sections 4.2-4.3;
which Licensee Product(s) the Licensed Software will be used in, if purchasing an OEM License as further described in section 4.4;
the number of Customer Installations, with or without developer rights, to be included in the License, if purchasing OEM License(s) as further described in section 4.4;
Any Affiliates to be included in the License.
The information listed in i.-vii. shall be stated in the License Statement.

All Optional Dependencies and Official Integrations and Add-ons are made available by Highsoft as an additional free-of-charge service, irrespective of the chosen Software product and License type, and shall not be deemed part of the Licensed Software.

Each License type grants Licensee a specific set of usage rights to Licensed Software, as described respectively in section 4.1 to 4.4 below. The offered license types described in sections 4.1 (Internal License), 4.2 (SaaS License) and 4.3 (SaaS+ License) are complementary in the sense that SaaS License and SaaS+ License each includes a gradual broadening of scope and extension of usage rights, compared to the Internal License, i.e. the SaaS License consumes and includes more extensive rights than the Internal License, so does the SaaS+ License with respect to the SaaS License. For the avoidance of doubt, an OEM License does not include any of the rights covered by an Internal License, a SaaS License or a SaaS+ License, unless such rights are added by Licensee’s optional choice pursuant to section 4.4.3 below (customization of an OEM License) and confirmed in the License Statement.

Depending on the purchased License type(s), sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.3 and/or 4.4 below shall apply. Section 3 and 5 shall apply to all License types and hence regardless of the chosen License type. The License type(s) chosen by Licensee shall be stated in Appendix A and in the License Statement.

Upon request, Highsoft may provide advice on which License type will be suitable for Licensee as this will mainly depend on Licensee’s use case. In such case, Highsoft will use its best effort to suggest a suitable License type based on the information provided by Licensee. Licensee shall bear the risk for the correctness and completeness of the information provided, and Highsoft provides no guarantees, express or implied, as to the suitability of the chosen License type(s) and hereby disclaims any and all liability related to the choice made by Licensee.

3.2. General Limitations
3.2.1. Number of Developers
Each License granted by Highsoft under this Agreement comes with a defined (limited) number of authorized Developers. Licensee acknowledges, accepts, and undertakes to ensure that the actual number of Developers at any given time, whether an employee or subcontractor of Licensee, shall not exceed the total number of Developers stated in License Statement. Any breach of this restriction shall be considered a material breach of the Agreement.

3.2.2. Usage by Affiliates
The License is granted to Licensee only and does not extend to Licensee’s Affiliates at the commencement of this Agreement, unless otherwise agreed between the Parties by way of express identification of such extended right in the License Statement, and subject to Licensee’s payment of the additional Affiliate Fee.

Licensee may at any time and subject to an additional Affiliate Fee purchase a right for its Affiliates to use the Licensed Software within the scope of the purchased License(s) and the number of Developers and Customer Installations defined therein (if applicable). Any such subsequent extension of the License to also cover Licensee’s Affiliates must, in order to be valid, be agreed in writing between the Parties. If Licensee wishes to purchase such an Affiliate extension, Licensee shall send to Highsoft a written notice, containing

(a) the number of Affiliates, and (b) the following information for each of the Affiliates that Licensee wishes to include in the purchased License(s):

Company name
Company registration no.
Nationality
Address
Contact information
Contact person
Highsoft will thereafter update the License Statement, which will state the applicable Affiliates included in the License. An extension of the License to include Affiliates shall for the avoidance of doubt not expand the usage rights granted through this Agreement or expand the scope of the granted License unless such

expansions of the License are concurrently requested and agreed between the Parties pursuant to section 17.8.

3.2.3. Access to new Releases
Subject to restrictions and limitations applicable to the purchased License type, a purchase of a License grants Licensee the right to use the applicable Release of the Licensed Software at the time of purchase, and any subsequent Releases released during Licensee’s enrollment in the Highcharts Advantage plan. In order to gain access to new Releases, Licensee must remain enrolled in the Highcharts Advantage plan as defined in section 5 below. Upon purchase of a License, Licensee will be automatically enrolled in the Highcharts Advantage plan, commencing on Delivery Date, and the first twelve (12) months of Licensee’s enrollment in the Highcharts Advantage plan shall be included in the License Fee at no additional cost.

Licensee undertakes not to make use of any Software in other or newer versions than the Release(s) of the Licensed Software which Licensee has obtained the right to use pursuant to the granted License and a subsequent valid enrollment in the Highcharts Advantage plan pursuant to section 5 below. Any breach of this restriction shall be considered a material breach of the Agreement.

A License granted under this Agreement is perpetual and not subject to renewal. The perpetual nature of the License is strictly limited to Release(s) of the Licensed Software to which Licensee has lawfully gained access and usage rights during a valid enrollment in the Highcharts Advantage plan. Notwithstanding its (otherwise) perpetual nature, such License shall nevertheless expire if the Agreement is lawfully terminated by Highsoft due to Licensee’s material breach, in accordance with section 13.3.

3.2.4. Access to Source Code
Licensee may download Licensed Software source code from the Highsoft Website, and may make own edits, and keep its own repositories with the modified source code.

Licensee shall not modify, delete or obscure any notices of proprietary rights or any Software identification or restrictions on or in Software found in the license-header of the code files.

3.2.5. No usage of Software in competing products
Licensee undertakes not to use Software as part of any offerings comprising functionality that is substantially similar to that of Software, during the term of this Agreement, and for a period of three (3) years after its termination, however occasioned. Nothing in this Agreement shall, however, be construed to preclude Licensee from using, marketing, licensing and/or selling software which is developed by Licensee on a fully independent basis, even if such software has the same or similar functionality as Software, provided always that the independent development can be clearly documented and that such activities do not infringe or jeopardize Highsoft’s intellectual property rights or are in breach of other related statutory or non-statutory rules of law.

3.3. Identification of SaaS Applications, Web Applications and Licensee Products
Licensed Software may only be incorporated into such SaaS Applications, Web Applications or Licensee Products as expressly identified and approved by Highsoft in the License Statement, and the names of such applications or products (as applicable) shall be provided by Licensee upon entering into this Agreement, in accordance with section 3.1. The Parties may agree in writing that the names of the SaaS Applications, Web Applications or Licensee Products (as applicable) shall be provided by Licensee to Highsoft after the Delivery Date, i.e. if the applications or products are still unnamed at the time of entering into this Agreement. In such case, the number of SaaS Applications, Web Applications or Licensee Products (as applicable) shall be listed in Appendix A and the License Statement, and the names of the SaaS Applications, Web Applications or Licensee Products (as applicable) shall be provided by Licensee to Highsoft after the Delivery Date, upon which the License Statement will be updated. Licensee is not authorized to use Licensed Software in any SaaS Applications, Web Applications or Licensee Products not identified in the License Statement, i.e. after notice has been provided to Highsoft in accordance with this paragraph.

Licensee may also choose to purchase a SaaS License, SaaS+ License or OEM License for use in future SaaS Applications, Web Applications or Licensee Products. Upon purchase of such License, Licensee shall inform Highsoft of the number of SaaS Applications, Web Applications and/or Licensee Products (as applicable) to be included in the License, so that Highsoft can list those as unnamed applications and/or Licensee Products in the License Statement.

In the event that the Licensee wishes to make use of such purchased License Licensee shall notify Highsoft of the name(s) of the application(s) and/or product(s) as well as any requested changes (if applicable) in the scope of the purchased License. Only after Licensee’s receipt of such update of the License Statement, by inclusion of the names of applicable application(s) and/or product(s), may the Licensee incorporate the Licensed Software into the specified application(s) or product(s).

While the non-reusable nature of SaaS, SaaS+ and OEM Licenses precludes Licensee from replacing a SaaS Application, Web Application or Licensee Product with another application or product under the same License (product replacement), it shall not preclude Licensee from changing the name of a SaaS Application, Web Application or Licensee Product covered by a License (name-change), and to request that the License Statement be adjusted accordingly.

3.4. Special terms for Highcharts Dashboards
For Licensed Software granted under a License that includes Highcharts Dashboards the following additional terms and conditions shall apply:

A License to use Highcharts Dashboards enables Licensee to:

use the standard components included in the library provided by Highsoft through Highcharts Dashboards; and
make custom components or add Third Party components to dashboards created using Highcharts Dashboards.
For the avoidance of doubt, any warranties and indemnifications provided by Highsoft in section 8 and 10 of this Agreement shall solely apply to the Highcharts Dashboards library as such and the standard components provided therein by Highsoft. Licensee shall indemnify and hold Highsoft harmless from and against any and all losses, claims and damages related to customized components or Third Party components developed or used by Licensee in relation to Highcharts Dashboards.

Highcharts Dashboards allows Developers to facilitate the modification of dashboards by other users, including Licensee employees, contractors, or Licensee’s customers and end users, through “Edit Mode”. The utilization of “Edit Mode” by these users to modify dashboards does not automatically classify them as Developers under the Agreement, nor does it contribute to the total count of allowed Developers under the License. However, these users must be restricted from working with or accessing the API or source code of the Licensed Software.

The restrictions of usage rights under an Internal License allowing only the generation of static content, cf. section 4.1 below, shall not prevent Licensee from allowing its users to access and use the “Editor Mode” to modify, add, remove, move, or resize components in dashboards created by Licensee provided that the parameters of interaction with and modification of such components remain the same for all such internal users, and that they are prevented from working with or accessing the API or source code of the Licensed Software.

4. License types and usage rights included
4.1. Internal License
Through an Internal License, Highsoft grants Licensee a non-exclusive, perpetual (for applicable Releases), non-sublicensable, worldwide right to install, reproduce, use and further develop Licensed Software as such:

on any number of public or private websites (including subdomains and intranet sites) for generation of static content, and
on any Internal Applications
An Internal License authorizes Licensee to use the Licensed Software for internal purposes only and extends to Licensee’s employees and contractors, but not to its clients, customers or other Third Parties. The Internal License does not include any right for Licensee to use the Licensed Software in a SaaS Application, Web Application or a Licensee Product, nor does it authorize Licensee to perform Customer Installations.

The restriction of usage rights granted under an Internal License for allowing the generation of “static content” only, means that the data set(s) in the content provided by Licensee on websites must be the same (identical) for all users, and that such websites shall not generate individually tailored content adapted to any user’s personal or individual data. For the avoidance of doubt, this shall not prevent the use of Licensed

Software under an Internal License to create interactive content, provided that the parameters for the interaction with the content remain the same for all users.

4.2. SaaS License
Through a SaaS License, Highsoft grants Licensee such rights that are covered by an Internal License with the addition of a non-exclusive, perpetual (for applicable Releases), non-reusable, worldwide right to install, reproduce, use and further develop Licensed Software as an integral part of either:

one (1) SaaS Application, or;
one (1) Web Application,
Licensed Software may only be incorporated into a SaaS Application or a Web Application explicitly identified and approved by Highsoft in the License Statement. Licensee is permitted to modify and enhance the designated SaaS Application or Web Application. However, due to the non-reusable nature of the SaaS License, Licensee is prohibited from substituting the existing SaaS Application or Web Application with a different one under the same License. In such instances, a new License must be acquired.

A SaaS License does not authorize Licensee to perform Customer Installations, and any such Customer Installations distributed by a Licensee holding only a SaaS License shall therefore be deemed invalid and shall be considered a material breach of this Agreement.

Except for the authorized use of the Licensed Software in either one (1) SaaS Application or one (1) Web Application as specified in the License Statement, Licensees only holding a SaaS License is under no circumstances authorized to transfer, rent, lease, lend, sell, copy, redistribute, or sublicense any Licensed Software, in itself or together with other software, or in any other way make Software available to any Third Party. Any attempt to do so shall be considered a material breach of this Agreement.

4.3. SaaS+ License
Through a SaaS+ License, Highsoft grants Licensee such rights that are covered by an Internal License with the addition of a non-exclusive, perpetual (for applicable Releases), non-reusable, worldwide right to install, reproduce, use and further develop Licensed Software in either:

Up to five (5) independent SaaS Applications; or
Up to five (5) independent Web Applications; or
Up to five (5) independent SaaS Applications and Web Applications as long as the total number of applications does not exceed five (5).
A SaaS+ License does not authorize Licensee to perform Customer Installations, and any distribution by Licensee of a SaaS Application or Web Application with Licensed Software embedded to a server owned or operated by a Licensee customer shall therefore be deemed unauthorized and shall be considered a material breach of this Agreement.

Except for the authorized use of the Licensed Software in accordance with letter a., b. or c. in this section

4.3 and as specified in the License Statement, Licensees solely holding a SaaS+ License are under no

circumstances authorized to transfer, rent, lease, lend, sell, copy, redistribute, or sublicense any Licensed Software, in itself or together with other software, or in any other way make Licensed Software available to any Third Party. Any attempt to do so shall be considered a material breach of this Agreement.

4.4. OEM License
4.4.1. Grants under the OEM License
Through an OEM License, Highsoft grants Licensee a non-exclusive, perpetual (for applicable Releases), non-reusable, worldwide right to install, reproduce, use, sublicense and further develop Licensed Software as an integral part of a Licensee Product, provided that such Licensee Product be supplied to Third Party through a Customer Installation, with or without the right for the Licensee’s customer to work with the API and/or source code of the Licensed Software (“Developer Rights”), dependent on Licensee’s choice as specified in License Statement.

The authorization to sublicense Licensed Software only applies when and as long as such Licensed Software lawfully is incorporated with Licensee Product supplied to Third Party in accordance with this Agreement.

4.4.2. Limitations to the OEM License
Licensee acknowledges, accepts, and undertakes to ensure that the actual number of Licensee Products and Customer Installations, with or without Developer Rights, shall not at any time exceed the total number of Licensee Products and Customer Installations selected by Licensee upon purchase of the License and confirmed in the License Statement.

Licensed Software may only be incorporated into such Licensee Products as expressly identified and approved by Highsoft in the License Statement.

Licensee shall be prohibited from reselling any Licensee Product or otherwise from granting its customers permission to use the Licensed Software, in any manner that contradicts the terms and restrictions of this Agreement or the License(s) granted hereunder.

4.4.3. Optional addition(s) of Websites, Internal Applications, SaaS Application(s) and/or Web Application(s) to the OEM License
Licensee may, subject to an additional fee, choose to customize the OEM License by adding the usage rights as provided under an Internal License, a SaaS License or a SaaS+ License. By doing so, depending on the chosen additions to the OEM License, Licensee will be authorized pursuant to the chosen additional License type to use the Licensed Software as such on any websites (public or private) and Internal Applications, and to incorporate Licensed Software into the number of SaaS Application and/or Web Application as specified by Licensee and approved by Highsoft in the License Statement.

5. Highcharts Advantage
5.1. Enrollment and Auto-Renewal
By purchasing a License under this Agreement, Licensee is automatically enrolled in Highsoft’s Highcharts Advantage plan. The Highcharts Advantage plan operates in twelve (12) months intervals commencing on Delivery Date (each twelve-month period constituting an “Advantage Period”).

5.2. Optional Fixed Advantage Period
Instead of the subscription-based Auto-Renewal of Highcharts Advantage described above in section 5.1, Licensee may, at the time of purchase of the License, choose to enroll in the Highcharts Advantage plan for fixed periods of up to five (5) years at a time (“Fixed Advantage Period”). If Licensee so chooses, the duration of Licensee’s Fixed Advantage Period shall be stated in the License Statement. At the end of the Fixed Advantage Period, Licensee’s enrollment will expire without further notice (no Auto Renewal), unless Licensee prior to the end of the Fixed Advantage Period renews its enrollment in the Highcharts Advantage plan with one or more Advantage Periods (“Extension”).

As set forth in section 17.8, the details regarding Licensee’s enrollment in the Highcharts Advantage plan will be listed in the License Statement. Unless otherwise stated at the time of purchase, Licensee’s enrollment in the Highcharts Advantage plan will by default be subject to Auto-Renewal as set forth in section 5.1.

Highcharts Advantage as set forth in this section, shall not extend to any Third Parties to which Licensee distributes Licensee Products, SaaS Application(s) or Web Application(s) containing Licensed Software or any parts of such.
